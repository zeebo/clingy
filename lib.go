// Package clingy is a library to create command line interfaces.
//
// The API is a design experiment that prioritizes discoverability
// of the code that uses it over anything else. There are two main
// ways that this can be seen.
//
// First, commands are defined in the same call that is used to
// execute them. In this way, you cannot define the tree of commands
// in a bunch of different files in the package, mutating state
// during init() functions, or otherwise. For example, consider
// the following execution:
//
//	ok, err := env.Run(ctx, func(cmds clingy.Commands) {
//		cmds.Group("files", "Commands related to files", func() {
//			cmds.New("copy", "Copy a file", new(cmdFilesCopy))
//			cmds.New("delete", "Delete a file", new(cmdFilesDelete))
//			cmds.New("read", "Read a file", new(cmdFilesRead))
//			cmds.New("list", "List some files", new(cmdFilesList))
//		})
//		...
//
// Because all of the commands are defined in that single spot, we know
// exactly which commands are available and where they are defined.
//
// Secondly, flags and arguments for commands are defined at the time
// they are loaded, and happen as part of a method call on the command
// implementation itself. This provides incentives to store the state
// on the command object itself. For example:
//
//	type someCommand struct {
//		first  string
//		second string
//	}
//
//	func (s *someCommand) Setup(params clingy.Parameters) {
//		s.first = params.Arg("first", "first required argument").(string)
//		s.second = params.Arg("second", "second required argument").(string)
//	}
//
// This causes the command implementation to be more discoverable because
// you have a single location that contains all of the state the command
// will inspect. This also aids in unit testing, because you can construct
// values directly and execute them, skipping the Setup step and avoiding
// having to make mocks or fakes to inject the parameters.
//
// In service of this goal, some tradeoffs are made. Most notably, the return
// type for arguments and flags is `interface{}` and type casts are required.
// This was found to be acceptable because in typical usage, the argument will
// be directly assigned into a typed struct field, so the compiler complains
// if an incorrect type assertion is used. This changes a dynamic failure to
// a minor redundancy. Additionally, the code with the type assertions is
// executed right away whenever a command is run, so any testing will surface
// any bugs.
//
// Enjoy!
